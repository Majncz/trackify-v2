# Trackify Cursor Rules

## CRITICAL RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE

### 1. NEVER deploy without explicit user request
- Only run `npm run deploy` when the user explicitly says "deploy", "deploy it", "push to prod", etc.
- Never deploy automatically after completing a feature

### 2. NEVER build or restart dev server for code changes  
- Hot reload is active - just save files and refresh browser
- DO NOT run `npm run build` during development
- DO NOT run `pkill` or restart the dev server for code changes

### 3. Only restart dev server after:
- Prisma schema changes (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- `package.json` changes (new dependencies)
- `.env` file changes
- Server crash (confirmed with `lsof -i :3002` showing nothing)

### 4. NEVER clear `.next` cache
- Clearing `.next` causes full rebuild and can deadlock the server
- If CSS looks broken, tell user to try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) first
- Only clear cache as absolute last resort after confirming it's corrupted

### 5. Troubleshooting order:
1. Ask user to hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check if server is responding (`curl -I https://dev.time.ranajakub.com/`)
3. Check if server process exists (`lsof -i :3002`)
4. Only restart if server is actually dead

## Development Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Save files (hot reload picks them up)
3. User refreshes browser
4. Done

## When User Says "Deploy"

Only then run: `npm run deploy "commit message"`
